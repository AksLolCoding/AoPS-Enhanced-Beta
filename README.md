# AoPS Enhanced Beta
You will need to use a userscript manager such as Tampermonkey to use this script.
This is still in Beta. Please report feedback/suggestions/bugs on Github.
To install the userscript, go to [aopsenhanced.user.js]([google.com./aopsenhanced.user.js](https://github.com/AksLolCoding/AoPS-Enhanced-Beta/raw/main/aopsenhanced.user.js). It will install it for you.
