# AoPS Enhanced Beta
You will need to use a userscript manager such as Tampermonkey to use this script.
This is still in Beta. Please report feedback/suggestions/bugs on Github.
To install the userscript, go to [aopsenhanced.user.js](https://github.com/AksLolCoding/AoPS-Enhanced-Beta/raw/main/aopsenhanced.user.js) and Tampermonkey will install it for you.

# Userscript Usage
To use the userscript, simply go to [https://artofproblemsolving.com/enhanced] or click "AoPS Enhanced" on the "Resources" dropdown at the top.
You can currently only use the "Settings" page and the "Delete Backup" page (I will publish AoPS Enhanced Backup soon), but I will add more pages soon.

#Q&A
- Why do I need to enter my login?
You must do this so that the script knows who you are. Once you sign in, you will not need to sign in again. Your password is not stored at all.
